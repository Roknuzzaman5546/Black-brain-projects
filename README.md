*****                 Queation and answer part      ******               

1. let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);

Ans:- A {}
Cause: Since the let variable is declared in the first line and the value set in the next line {} will be the value of....

2. function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");

Ams:- C "12"
Cause: Since the value is given by calling the parameter of the function here, the sum of the two will be the value

3. const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };
info.favoriteFood = "🍝";
console.log(food);

Ans:_ A ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']

Cause:Since the first line here declares the value of food and since it is a const variable, the value of food here will be A;

4. function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}
console.log(sayHi())

Ans:- C: Hi there, null

Cause:Since the function returns Hi there. And when the function is called, if the value is null then its value will be hi there & null


5. let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});
console.log(count);

Ans:- B:2

Cause: Since first Foreach is executed on the Nums array then the count value is decremented by 1. So if you log the value of count ser to the console, its value will be 2
